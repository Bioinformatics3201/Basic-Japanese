<h1>Hello fellow classmates! Let's learn some basic Japanese</h1> 

## basic alphabet in hiragana 

あいうえお　read as: a i u e o

かきくけこ read as: ka ki ku ke ko

さしすせそ read as: sa shi su se so 

たちつてと read as: ta chi tsu te to 
 
なにぬねの read as: na ni nu ne no

らりるれろ read as: ra ri ru re ro

はひふへほ read as: ha hi fu he ho 

まみむめも read as: ma mi mu me mo 

わをん read as: wa o n

やゆよ read as: ya yu yo 


The most simplest form of Japanese characters are called ひらがな　or hiragana on the left
ろまじ　or Romaji is the method of writing Japanese words using the Roman alphabet as seen on the right. It is also pronounced how it is written on Romaji 

Here we can see the most simplest form of Japanese langauge learned by infants at a young age just as how we learned our own alpabet when we were young.


## basic greetings 

こんにちは read as: konnichiwa translated as: Hello, Hi, or Good afternoon

おはようございます read as: ohayogozaimasu translated as: Good morning 

こんばんは read as: konbanwa translated as: Good evening

さようなら read as: sayonara translated as: Goodbye

おげんきですか read as: ogenkidesuka translated as: How are you or are you well 

げんきです read as: genkidesu translated as: I'm good or I'm well

ありがとうございました read as: arigatogozaimasu translated as: Thank you very much 

どういたしまして read as: doitashimashite translated as: You're welcome 

## kanji and katakana 

These are just many forms of the Japanese Alphatbet, there's also カタカナ or katana form and 漢字　or かんじ　or kanji which is derived from chinese characters. 

### kanji example 

The kanji for Japan is 日本, the hiragana is にっぽん, the romaji is nippon 
The kanji for Japan is 日本語, the hiragana is にっぽんご, the romaji is nihongo

Notice the differences between the two? they might have the same charters on the first two but they are pronounced differently, or their phonology


### katakana example 

The katakana for America is　アメリカ, the hiragana is あめりか, the romaji is amerika
The katakana for French fries is　フライドポテト, the hiragana is ふらいどぽてと, the romaji is furaidopoteto

Notice anything any similarities between the Romaji and the English word? They are very similar in pronounciation!
